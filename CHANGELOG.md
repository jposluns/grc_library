# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are recorded in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) loosely; individual document versions follow semantic versioning as defined in [`specification-ingestion.md`](specification-ingestion.md). The library as a whole carries a Calendar Versioning (CalVer) version of the form `YYYY.MM.patch`; see [`specification-master-project.md`](specification-master-project.md) section 4.5.

## 2026-05-31, Library Version 2026.05.137

Corpus-wide hyperlink sweep and TODO.md cleanup.

### Changed

- Converted 414 unlinked backtick-wrapped file references to markdown links across 48 files (root specs, governance, compliance, security, privacy, resilience, operations, supply-chain, dev-security, ai, docs, tools). Detection extends the existing [`tools/lint-changelog-link-coverage.py`](tools/lint-changelog-link-coverage.py) regex across every markdown file. Resolution order: relative to source dir, relative to repo root, tail-path match, then unique-basename fallback. Adopter-project filenames (Claude rule files, AGENTS files, package manifests), placeholder patterns containing angle brackets / braces / wildcards, command-line invocations, and references to deleted or external-project files are intentionally left as code-formatted text. 43 residual code-formatted references remain by design.
- Removed stale CC0-era artefacts from [`TODO.md`](TODO.md): P1/P2/P3 placeholder sections (phase references no longer mapped to the public-release history), P6.2 OT/ICS (verifiably complete in [`operations/ot/`](operations/ot/)), and phase-number prefixes on Decisions log entries. Rephrased P6.1 to focus on the remaining multi-cloud governance gap (per-cloud baselines already shipped in [`dev-security/`](dev-security/)). Nuanced P5.7 (Saudi Arabia annex exists; Argentina/Mexico in the Latin America annex) and P5.8 (US/China AI rules already partially covered in the respective privacy annexes).

### Fixed

- One-line content-generation typo in [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) introduced by an earlier direct-to-main MCP push: line 28 `# restrict scope to specific paths` corrected to `# regen-and-check`.

### Verification

Full audit programme (32 gates) and regression suite (70 tests) run standalone immediately before commit: all green.
