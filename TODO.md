# TODO

Living backlog of planned enhancements for the GRC Documentation Library. Items are added when identified and removed when completed. Completed work is recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); this file holds only pending and queued items.

This file is informational and is not subject to the library's metadata-block, audit-conformance, or version-tracking conventions. The other repository-root meta files that share this exemption are [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) (a chronological log that mutates with every PR) and [`instruction-ai-document-ingestion.md`](instruction-ai-document-ingestion.md) (an AI system prompt, not a governance document). As of `2026-06-02`, [`README.md`](README.md), [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), [`AUTHORS.md`](AUTHORS.md), and [`docs/worked-example.md`](docs/worked-example.md) each carry the canonical 13-field metadata block and are validated by the corpus metadata audit (gate 1).

## Priority 4 — adopter experience

### 4.1 Quickstart templates per adopter profile

Shipped 2026-06-20 as [`docs/template-quickstart.md`](docs/template-quickstart.md) (v2.0.0). Core baseline plus five stacking dimensions (Activity, Data scope, Audience, Regulatory exposure, GRC capacity) with about twenty modules; three worked examples. The original v1.0.0 fixed-profile structure (PR #103) was rejected by the maintainer as too rigid; the rewrite (PR #105) adopts an activity-modular composition shape that lets adopters combine modules à la carte.

### 4.2 Maturity assessment interactive template

Shipped 2026-06-20 as [`docs/template-maturity-self-assessment.md`](docs/template-maturity-self-assessment.md). Guided markdown checklist covering 11 library domains across a 5-tier maturity ladder (Initial / Developing / Defined / Managed / Optimising); per-tier next-step guidance; recording template.

### 4.3 Implementation roadmap templates

Shipped 2026-06-20 as [`docs/template-implementation-roadmap.md`](docs/template-implementation-roadmap.md). Three-phase (Floor / Operational / Year-1 close) sequence at 90 / 180 / 365 days for the reference E2 pace, with pace adjustments for E1, E3, E4 capacity tiers and for composition complexity. Designed to sequence the modules picked via the quickstart template; not per-profile.

### 4.4 Regulator interaction templates

Shipped 2026-06-20 as [`compliance/template-regulator-interaction.md`](compliance/template-regulator-interaction.md). Five sub-templates in one consolidated document: breach notification, attestation submission, examination support, periodic report submission, regulatory inquiry response. Shape-only; jurisdiction- and sector-specific timing/format requirements live in the relevant annex or sector folder.

### 4.5 Audit evidence package templates

The library documents per-control evidence requirements across the compliance and risk domains. The packaging step (assembling per-control evidence into an audit-ready bundle: control list, evidence per control, cross-references, gap rationale where partial) is not yet templated. A single template document would close the bookkeeping gap for adopters preparing for an external audit. Surfaced from [`governance/register-coverage-gaps.md`](governance/register-coverage-gaps.md) §6.

## Priority 5 — content expansion

### 5.1 Logistics country/programme expansion

The WCO AEO Compendium identifies 77+17 ≈ 94 trusted-trader programmes globally; the library currently covers 4 (BASC, CTPAT-US, AEO-UK, PIP-Canada). Highest-priority additions:
- EU AEO (covers 27 member states under EU Union Customs Code Art 38)
- Mexico NEEC / OEA
- Australia Trusted Trader (ATT)
- Singapore STP / STP-Plus
- Japan AEO
- Korea AEO
- New Zealand Secure Exports Scheme (SES)
- China AEO

### 5.2 Financial-services country regulator overlays

Country-level financial-regulator annexes within `compliance/financial-services/`:
- UK PRA/FCA (`annex-uk-pra-fca.md`)
- US OCC/FRB/FDIC/SEC/FINRA
- Canada OSFI
- Australia APRA
- Singapore MAS
- Japan FSA

### 5.3 Healthcare country regulator overlays

Within `compliance/healthcare/`:
- US HIPAA detail (Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule, HITECH)
- UK NHS DSPT (Data Security and Protection Toolkit)
- EU MDR/IVDR (Medical Device Regulation; In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation)
- Canada PHIPA and provincial frameworks
- Australia My Health Records Act

### 5.4 Energy and utilities country regulator overlays

### 5.7 Privacy jurisdiction gaps

Existing privacy domain covers 25 country annexes. Known gaps or stale entries:
- Argentina (PDPA 2025 update pending; currently covered in the Latin America annex)
- Saudi Arabia PDPL (dedicated annex exists; recent updates pending)
- Mexico LFPDPPP (currently covered in the Latin America annex; standalone annex possible)
- Re-review of EU member state derogations where applicable

### 5.8 AI jurisdiction overlays

The library cites EU AI Act extensively but lacks a dedicated `ai/jurisdictions/` subdirectory parallel to `privacy/jurisdictions/`. Candidates:
- EU AI Act detailed annex (`ai/jurisdictions/annex-ai-european-union.md`)
- Canada AIDA
- UK AI policy framework
- US state-by-state AI laws (Colorado AI Act, NYC bias audit law, etc.; partial coverage exists today inside the US privacy annex but a dedicated AI-jurisdiction annex would be cleaner)
- China generative AI rules (partial coverage exists today inside the China privacy annex)
- Korea AI framework

## Priority 6 — domain-level expansion (longer-term)

### 6.1 Multi-cloud governance overlay

Per-cloud hardening baselines for AWS, Azure, and GCP exist in `dev-security/`. The remaining gap is multi-cloud governance (cross-cloud risk taxonomy, cross-cloud incident coordination, cloud-portfolio-level controls). Could live in `operations/` or warrant a new `cloud/` domain.

### 6.2 Identity-specific content depth

Customer Identity (CIAM) governance, workforce identity governance, identity federation patterns, passwordless adoption playbooks. The library has an Identity and Access Management policy and procedure but no dedicated content for these patterns.

### 6.3 Quantum cryptography readiness deepening

The library has a PQC roadmap at phase level ([`security/roadmap-post-quantum-cryptography.md`](security/roadmap-post-quantum-cryptography.md)). The roadmap covers discovery, standards, pilot, and migration phases but not detailed implementation content. Pending additions: PQC migration playbook (operational steps per system class), crypto-agility patterns (key abstraction, algorithm switching, hybrid schemes), and post-quantum-ready CA / PKI management.

### 6.4 Cross-framework matrix expansion

Current matrix ([`governance/matrix-cross-framework-alignment.md`](governance/matrix-cross-framework-alignment.md)) covers major frameworks; could expand coverage to additional sectoral and regional frameworks as the country/sector content under Priority 5 grows.

## Decisions log

Items considered and explicitly dropped, with rationale. Recorded here so the reasoning is preserved if the question recurs.

### Strict Related-Documents reciprocity dropped

Original plan: add a linter enforcing that if document A's Related Documents lists B, then B's Related Documents lists A. Empirical run found 1,269 non-reciprocal references across 266 of 280 active documents.

The library's actual convention is **asymmetric** Related Documents: each document lists "what this document consumes / relates to from its own perspective", not "the complete bidirectional graph". This is a reasonable, content-author-friendly convention.

The underlying concern (catching half-updated cross-references during refactors) is already covered by [`lint-links.py`](tools/lint-links.py) (broken-link detection).

Decision: dropped. Not pursued in narrower form (doctype-pair rules) because the marginal value over [`lint-links.py`](tools/lint-links.py) does not justify the maintenance cost of a curated rule set with many exemptions.

### Cross-document numerical coherence shipped as scaffold

Original plan in the audit-roadmap: a linter that flags numerical drift on canonical-term thresholds (RTO, RPO, P1/P2/P3/P4 acknowledgement times, retention periods) across documents.

Empirical analysis found that incident-severity terminology (P1/P2/P3/P4) legitimately carries different numeric values per SLA dimension: acknowledgement time, resolution time, escalation interval, notification time. A naive "same Pn = same value" check would false-positive on legitimate per-dimension variation.

Decision: ship as scaffold (regex framework with unit normalisation and aggregation), with the term set widened incrementally as empirical data warranted. The scaffold's progression:

- Phase 23.26 added P1/P2/P3 acknowledgement-time patterns as scaffolding (each requires a Pn-prefix-with-explicit-acknowledgement-time prose shape on the same line; the patterns match 0 documents on the current corpus by design, since the corpus carries Pn-acknowledgement times in tabular form rather than the strict prose shape).
- Phase 23.35 added the GDPR breach-notification-hours pattern after empirical confirmation that 8 or more documents reference the statutory 72-hour deadline and all agree on the value.

The current scaffold tracks four terms (P1/P2/P3 acknowledgement-time patterns plus GDPR-breach-notification-hours); see `TERM_PATTERNS` in [`tools/lint-cross-doc-numbers.py`](tools/lint-cross-doc-numbers.py) for the live set. The linter's docstring documents why RTO, RPO, retention periods, P4 acknowledgement, NIS 2 reporting windows, and DORA reporting windows are deliberately NOT curated (each is either context-dependent, has multiple legitimate per-deadline sub-patterns that need separate regex, or appears too few times in the corpus to justify a curated pattern).

Honest scope management is preferred over either (a) silently producing false positives or (b) defining the term set without sufficient operational data. The maintainer revisits the term set when corpus evolution introduces a new prose shape that warrants pattern coverage.

### Phase-completion gating requires the full audit-programme sweep

A prior bundled commit's pre-merge audit pass omitted several gates and consequently merged 5 audit-gate violations (filename/doctype prefix mismatch on the bundle index, 15 em-dash language findings, one broken intra-repo link, one mislabelled hallucinated framework version, one unresolved intra-document reference). All were caught and corrected in the immediately following cleanup.

Decision: phase-completion gating requires the full audit-programme sweep ([`tools/run_all_audits.sh`](tools/run_all_audits.sh); see [`governance/specification-audit-programme.md`](governance/specification-audit-programme.md) §6 for the canonical inventory) to pass locally before any push. The pre-commit hook configuration operationalises this in git itself.

The convention is: at each commit, the maintainer (or AI verifier) runs every gate in a single batch (not a selective subset) and only proceeds to push when zero violations remain.

### No verification of standard content versus library interpretation

When the AI Security Tooling Landscape Register was created, it asserted capability claims for each project. The Citation Verification Specification §14 explicitly excludes "verification of standard content versus the library's interpretation of it" from the methodology scope.

Decision: verification covers metadata (existence, version, publication date, supersedence, ID format) and integrity anchors (commit SHA, Wayback snapshot URL). It does NOT verify that the library's prose interpretation of a project's capabilities is accurate. That would require the library to engage in interpretation disputes with project authors; the methodology stays at the citation-metadata layer.
